During my chemistry graduation, I discovered my passion for coding, inspired by tools like ChemSketch & ChemDraw. It was then that I decided to dive into web development. I started by learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and as I practiced, my interest grew. Fast forward to today, I’ve leveled up with React, and I'm on a mission to transition into Full-Stack Development while sharing my learning process and experiences along the way. 🚀
